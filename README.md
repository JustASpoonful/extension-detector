## Extension Fingerprints

Chrome extensions can be detected by fetching their web accessible resources. These are files inside an extension that can be accessed by web pages. The detected extensions can be used to track you through browser fingerprinting.

## Browser Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting is a type of online tracking thatâ€™s more invasive than ordinary cookie-based tracking. A digital fingerprint is created when a company makes a unique profile of you based on your computer hardware, software, add-ons, and even preferences. Your settings like the screen you use, the fonts installed on your computer, and even your choice of a web browser can all be used to create a fingerprint.

## Web Accessible Resources

Web-accessible resources are files inside an extension that can be accessed by web pages or other extensions. Extensions typically use this feature to expose images or other assets that need to be loaded in web pages, but any asset included in an extension's bundle can be made web accessible.

By default no resources are web accessible; only pages or scripts loaded from an extension's origin can access that extension's resources. Extension authors can use the web_accessible_resources manifest property to declare which resources are exposed and to what origins.

### Manifest v2 declaration

```
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "test1.png",
    "test2.png".
  ]
```

### Manifest v2 declaration

```
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "test1.png", "test2.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://gihub.com/*" ]
    }
  ],
```

## Detecting Extensions

### Fetching web accessible resources

```
yarn
yarn run start
```

### Resource timing comparison

While the chrome.debugger API is active, a bar under the address bar is displayed. Hiding the bar is only possible when the --silent-debugger-extension-api command-line switch is used.

### MetaMask

Unfortunately Vytal doesn't work on Firefox since Firefox doesn't support the debugger API for extensions. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#browser_compatibility
